#  Rebecca Kasten's Art Portfolio Site
My client requested me to create an art portfolio site so she could present her work to future employers. Creating this website helped me understand the expectations of a client/developer relationship, and I was able to gain valuable experience working independently.

I had the luxury of designing my client’s website, and this freedom allowed me to create multiple sketches of the site for my client so she can pick and choose what features she desired. I created mock-ups of the design and made edits to fulfill my client's wishes before fully fledging into building her website.

I impressed my client by completing the website in half the time she expected and building features that she thought were impossible. Building something I’ve never built before was challenging, but I enjoyed pushing myself and using this experience as a learning opportunity.
